# Currency Converter

I mainly built this project to better understand and work with the react framework overall. In addition, I also learned to request api calls to get data for my program and create custom hooks to better organize my code. Finally, the most important thing I was able to use in action was the re-usable components in react. While I have been following various tutorials to learn react, I was never able to put the theory shown to use which I finally was able to do with this project. 

Overall, I learned a lot through this project and while it was meant only for the sole purpose of getting a better grasp on the framework, I am proud of the work I've done!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
